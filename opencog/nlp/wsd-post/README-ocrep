WordNet sense tags carry ontology relationships (is-a, part-of); thus,
tagging parsed sentences with WordNet sense tags is useful.  This README
reviews tagging markup and, in particular, the interpretation of the 
truth values.

There are two ways of obtaining weighted markup of words; one is via
the Mihalcea algo, the other is by lookup from syntax tables.  The 
code in the nlp/wsd directory generates the following linkages:

   InheritanceLink (ctv strength=1.0 confidence=0.0 count=1.347564)
      WordInstanceNode "bark@144"
      WordSenseNode "bark%1:28:00::"

Note that it uses a CountTruthValue; the sense ranks are stored in the 
count field; these typically range from -0.5 to +3.5

XXX -- need tool to convert above into confidence values.

XXX -- need tool to read in sense values from disjunct database.

The confidence of sense tags can be strengthened by comparing 
semantics relationships found in the parsed text (is-a, part-of
relations) to similar relations present in WordNet.
