; Given a list of relations, sort the relations in "sentence order"
; (or "parse order"). The "sent-node" argument provides the 
; sentence by whitch to sort the relations, and the "word" argument
; gives the word relative to which the sort should be done.
; So, for example, given 
;
;        +---Os---+
;        |    +-Ds+
;        |    |   | 
;     heard.v a dog.
;
; and the word "dog" and the relations "Ds Os", this will return "Os Ds"
; because "heard" comes before "a", and so "Os" comes before "Ds".
