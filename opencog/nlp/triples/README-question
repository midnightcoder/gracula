               Question-Answering by Pattern Matching
               --------------------------------------

Consider the factual statement capital_of(France,Paris). This provides
an answer to the WH-question capital_of(France, what) and simple pattern
matching is enough to supply the answer.  The only extra work we need to
do here is to validate that the second triple is really a WH-question. 
Towards that end, we write the rule:

   IF $prep($var, $qvar) ^  # the question
      &query_var($qvar) ^   # validate WH-question
      $prep($var, $ans)     # answer
   THEN
      &declare_answer($ans)

Here, &query_var($qvar) is a previously defined hypergraph used to
pattern match a question obtained from the parser. The current parser
identifies questions in several way; one is by linking WH-words (what,
wher, when, etc) to a DefinedLinguisticConceptNode.  Note that is is
not a just simple scan for WH-words in a sentence -- rather, the parser
has identified the question in other ways.  This is important, because 
WH-words can be used in sentences that are not questions (for example: 
"That is what I said." is not a WH-question).  

Anyway, for the current parser, the the following should be sufficient
for &query_var($qvar):

   OrLink
      InheritanceLink
         VariableNode $qvar
         DefinedLinguisticConceptNode "what"
      InheritanceLink
         VariableNode $qvar
         DefinedLinguisticConceptNode "when"
      InheritanceLink
         VariableNode $qvar
         DefinedLinguisticConceptNode "where"
      InheritanceLink
         VariableNode $qvar
         DefinedLinguisticConceptNode "who"
      InheritanceLink
         VariableNode $qvar
         DefinedLinguisticConceptNode "why"

The above presumes that $qvar will match to a WordInstanceNode. 

The &declare_answer($ans) should expand to a hypergraph declaring the
answer in some what. Fro the current implementation, the following
cheesy hack will be used:

   ListLink
      AnchorNode "# QUERY SOLUTION"
      VariableNode $ans

The above needs to be fixed soon.
