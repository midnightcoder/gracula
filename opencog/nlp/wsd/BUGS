A list of known bugs that need to be fixed:
-------------------------------------------

* The distance between two identical senses is computed incorectly. 
  This can occur if the same word occurs twice in a sentence; the
  software tries to establish a sense for each occurrence, and is
  lead to consider the sense-similarity of identical senses.

* The computation of word-sense similarity measures is stunningly slow.
  This needs to be fixed, and/or alternate algorithms considered, and
  or a set of pre-computed similarities needs to be maintained.

* A set of guile maintainance routines need to be developed to 
  delete sentences and all thier parses.
