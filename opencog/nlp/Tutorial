Link Grammar is a parser
========================
http://www.abisource.com/projects/link-grammar/

   linkparser> John threw the ball
   Found 1 linkage (1 had no P.P. violations)
	   Unique linkage, cost vector = (CORP=6.0467 UNUSED=0 DIS=0 AND=0 LEN=5)
   
             +-----Os----+
      +--Ss--+     +--Ds-+
      |      |     |     |
   John.m threw.v the ball.n 

-- Links are Ss,Os,Ds
-- Ss == Subject, singular
-- Os == Object, singular
-- Ds == Determiner, singular

-- There are about 100 link types, and many more subtypes.
-- Links are bidirectional; no head-word.
-- Words have "disjuncts" which fit like puzzle pieces:
   e.g. threw: S- & O+  means that verb "threw" must have
   subject on left, object on right.
-- Parser arranges puzzle pieces until all fit together.
-- Disjuncts form context-free grammar.


RelEx is a dependency relation extractor
======================================== 
http://opencog.org/wiki/RelEx

-- Uses link-grammar input to obtain relations:
   _subj (<<throw>>, <<John>>) 
   _obj (<<throw>>, <<ball>>)

-- First word of the relation is the "head word",
   the second word is the "dependent" word:
   e.g. "John threw the red ball"

    _amod (<<ball>>, <<red>>)

-- Also performs feature tagging:
   Features are part-of-speech, tense, noun-number, etc.

   pos (ball, noun)
   noun_number (ball, singular)
   DEFINITE-FLAG (ball, T)
   pos (throw, verb)
   tense (throw, past)
   person-FLAG (John, T)

-- RelEx "extracts" information from the parse-graph by means of 
   "pattern matching" on subgraphs:

   e.g. "if link-type is Ss then word on left is singular"
   e.g. "if link-type is Os then word on right is singular"
   e.g. "if link-type is Ss then word on right is verb"
   e.g. "if link-type is Os then word on right is noun"

   A sequence of "rules" are applied:

   "if (predicate) then implication"
   where "predicate" is a graph pattern to be matched,
   and "implication" is a set of nodes/edges to be added, deleted.

   Result of applying pattern-match rules results in a transformation 
   of the graph.

-- Pattern matching (and all of RelEx) implemented in Java.
-- Pattern matching fairly closely tied to linguistics
-- Pattern matching is on graphs, not hypergraphs.

-- RelEx has other assorted other functions too ... 
   (framenet, pronoun resolution, entity identification, ...)


Parsed sentences as OpenCog hypergraphs
=======================================
-- Can be output directly from RelEx
-- Can be quickly generated from a "compact parse format":
   Allows parsed texts to be saved, input to opencog later.

-- Word instances are a special case of a word:
   (ReferenceLink (stv 1.0 1.0)
      (WordInstanceNode "John@df4398c5-7f03-45c9-bb30-85f715ba83c0")
      (WordNode "John")
   )

-- Word instances belong to a parse:
   (WordInstanceLink (stv 1.0 1.0)
      (WordInstanceNode "John@df4398c5-7f03-45c9-bb30-85f715ba83c0")
      (ParseNode "sentence@235033cb-a934-4a57-8b0f-0307705ed931_parse_0")
   )

-- Parses belong to a sentence; sentences belong to a document, etc.
-- Link Grammar links:

   (EvaluationLink (stv 1.0 1.0)
      (LinkGrammarRelationshipNode "Os")
      (ListLink
         (WordInstanceNode "threw@e69139f2-6322-4836-9d8c-73ce8d1cf881")
         (WordInstanceNode "ball@f6aa0e0a-fc4b-40f6-b5b9-2b441393bda5")
      )
   )

-- Relex Relations:
   ; _obj (<<throw>>, <<ball>>) 
   (EvaluationLink (stv 1.0 1.0)
      (DefinedLinguisticRelationshipNode "_obj")
      (ListLink
         (WordInstanceNode "threw@e69139f2-6322-4836-9d8c-73ce8d1cf881")
         (WordInstanceNode "ball@f6aa0e0a-fc4b-40f6-b5b9-2b441393bda5")
      )
   )

-- Word features:
   ; tense (throw, past)
   (InheritanceLink (stv 1.0 1.0)
      (WordInstanceNode "threw@e69139f2-6322-4836-9d8c-73ce8d1cf881")
      (DefinedLinguisticConceptNode "past")
   )

-- Clearly very verbose; lots of information about the input sentences.


"La Cogita" Chatbot
===================
bzr: opencog/nlp/chatbot/README

-- A quick-n-dirty hookup of IRC to link-grammar/relex to OpenCog
-- "remembers" what it was told.
-- It was "told" about 5K simple assertions from the MIT ConceptNet
   project: e.g. "Baseball is a sport".
-- Can answer simple questions about what it was told, using hypergraph
   pattern matching. 
-- Single-word replies, since NL generation not hooked up yet.

-- NO REASONING, INFERENCE WHATSOEVER. Chatbot is as dumb as a rock!


Pattern matching
================
bzr: opencog/query/README

-- Similar in idea to RelEx pattern matching, but this time its
   1) fully general, 2) implemented within OpenCog.

-- Given a hypergraph, containing VariableNodes, find a matching 
   hypegraph which "solves" or "grounds" the variables.

-- Example: "Who threw a ball?"
    _subj (<<throw>>, <<_$qVar>>)
    _obj (<<throw>>, <<ball>>) 

   is easily grounded by:
   _subj (<<throw>>, <<John>>) 
   _obj (<<throw>>, <<ball>>)

   Answer to question: John.

-- Example: "What did John throw?"

    _subj (<<throw>>, <<John>>) 
    _obj (<<throw>>, <<_$qVar>>) 

    Answer to question: ball

-- Pattern matcher is "completely general", works for any hypergraph,
   not just NLP.

-- Works vaguely like push-down automaton, maintains stack of partial
   matches/groundings.  

-- Final accept/reject of a potential match is determined by user
   callback, and is thus configurable.  

-- Solutions/groundings are reported via callback, too, so search can be
   run to exhaustion, or terminated early.

-- Can test for "optional" clauses, and/or absence of clauses (to reject
   matches that also contain certain subgraphs).

-- Currently used primarily for performing implications "IF P THEN Q"
   i.e. if a match to pattern P is found, then create pattern Q. Both
   P and Q contain variables.


Semantic normalization aka Semantic Triples
===========================================
-- "triples" are very fashionable:
   "Semantic Web", OWL, RDF, N3, SPARQL, ISO Topic Maps, 
   Semantic Nets, Upper Ontology, etc.

-- Although a triple can be "any" list of three items
   e.g. (_obj, throw, ball)

   A "semantic triple" captures a "semantic" relation:

   e.g. capital_of(Spain, Madrid)

-- Often prepositional in nature ("kind_of", "inside_of", "next_to"...)
   but can copular: "is-a", "has-a"

-- Can provide (partial) solution to normalization problem:
   e.g. "The capital of Spain is Madrid"

   _subj (<<be>>, <<capital>>)
   _obj (<<be>>, <<Madrid>>)
   of (<<capital>>, <<Spain>>)

   FAILS to pattern match the question: "What is the capital of Spain?":

   _subj (<<be>>, <<_$qVar>>)
   _obj (<<be>>, <<capital>>)
   of (<<capital>>, <<Spain>>)
   COPULA-QUESTION-FLAG (capital, T)
   QUERY-TYPE (_$qVar, what)

   because subject, object are reversed. 
   The semantic triple provides a (partial) solution for this.
   
-- Implemented by means of pattern matching: e.g.

   ; Sentence: "The capital of Germany is Berlin"
   ; var0=capital, var1=Berlin var2=Germany
   # IF %ListLink("# APPLY TRIPLE RULES", $sent)
         ^ %WordInstanceLink($var0,$sent)  ; $var0 and $var1 must be
         ^ %WordInstanceLink($var1,$sent)  ; in the same sentence
         ^ _subj(be,$var0) ^ _obj(be,$var1)   ; reversed subj, obj
         ^ $prep($var0,$var2)              ; preposition
         ^ %LemmaLink($var0,$word0)        ; word of word instance
         ^ $phrase($word0, $prep)          ; convert to phrase
         THEN ^3_$phrase($var2, $var1)

   Above is actual rule: it is converted to an OpenCog 
   ImplicationLink (quite verbose!) and run through pattern matcher.

-- Noteworthy: Makes use of "processing anchors" i.e.
   the sentence $sent MUST be connected, via ListLink to 

       AnchorNode "# APPLY TRIPLE RULES"

   i.e. this rule does *not* apply to all sentences ever read, but only
   those sentences that are attached to this AnchorNode.
   After processing, the anchor is released.

Semes, Reference Resolution
===========================
-- Consider two sentences: "John threw a ball" and "What did John throw?"
   How can we know that the "John" in the first sentence is the same 
   thing as the "John" in the second sentence?

-- Answer: create "semes", which behave like words, but represent a 
   single concept across multiple sentences. Thus, "John" is a seme.

-- Semes are "decorated" by modifiers in the same way that words are 
   decorated by modifiers. For example: "green ball" -- green is a 
   "decoration" on "ball".

-- Words can be "promoted" to semes using many different algorithms. 
   One of the simplest is to compare decorations. Thus, "green ball"
   and "red ball" cannot refer to the same seme "ball", because the 
   decorations differ. These must be two distinct semes (in this case,
   two different balls).



Common-sense Reasoning
======================
-- Not implemented, under construction, wide open for experimentation!

-- Starting point: Read in many sentences, e.g. from MIT ConceptNet,
   which has 800K ++ "common-sense" assertions: "Ice cream is made from milk"
   Parse them.  Extract semantic triples. Remember them. Answer questions.

-- Use reasoning to answer: "Aristotle is a man. All men are mortal. 
   Is Aristotle mortal?"

-- Use reasoning for sense-disambiguation: "I heard a bark in the night": 
   Can one hear "tree bark"? No. So "bark" is probably not "tree bark".

-- Concept formation, refinement:  Today: "What is an instrument?"
   Answer: "cymbal ukulele scale drum chronometer saxophone"
   Oh you meant "musical instrument", not "scientific instrument".

   Musical instruments make a sounds, scientific instruments usually
   do not: "I heard a chronometer in the night".


Important things this tutorial did not cover:
=============================================
-- Many link-grammar details, including post-grocessing, SAT solver
-- Framenet-like markup in RelEx
-- Pronoun/anaphora resolution in RelEx
-- Word-sense disambiguation in OpenCog.


Fun queries:
============
what is a tunnel?
what is an instrument?



Open Research Questions
=======================

-- How to extended the hard-coded triples, seme and qeustion-answering
   code using automated systems, e.g. Markov Logic Nets [USP09].

-- I have a feeling that about 100 or patterns (for the triples
   and QA code) will take care of the most common, basic expression
   types, but I don't know.  It would be interesting to quantify.

-- I learned that one must be careful to not over-generalize: e.g.  
   its easy to mistake a question for a statement, and introduce
   erroneous "facts".  Its not clear how narrow the rules must be,
   and still be useful.

-- There are some interesting data representation issues involving
   adverbs and other modifiers, esp modifiers to the predicate part of 
   a triples.

-- Its unclear how large, complex sentences fit into the picture.

-- I started some work on basic reasoning, but got distracted.
   Hand-coding some of these relationships should be fun. 
   e.g. If Berlin is a capital and capitals are cities then Berlin is
   a city.  Again, there's a question of how many of such hard-coded
   deductive rules are needed to handle a "majority" of cases.
