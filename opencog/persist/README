               AtomSpace Communications and Persistence
               -----------------------------------------

Various different systems used for the persistence of atoms to disk,
database or remote locations. Some of these systems are also general
systems for communicating atoms between servers.

Systems include:

file -- file-based storage
hypertable -- experimental HyperTable support.
memcache -- experimental/broken, uses memcached for persistence.
sql -- works well for most uses -- with caveats
xml -- XML-based file storage
