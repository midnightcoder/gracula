                     HyperTable Support
                     ------------------

This directory uses Hypertable to support persistent and (eventually)
distributed storage of atoms. Two things are needed in order for it
to work:

1. HyperTable must be installed (of course). See http://hypertable.org

2. The Hypertable servers must be running. The command to start them is:
      <hypertable_install_dir>/bin/start-all-servers.sh <local | hadoop | kfs>


If things don't work:
A. Make sure that the hypertable code is passing its own test suite!

B. Verify that CMake correctly found the location of the hypertable
   install location, and the hypertable config file.  These are needed!
   The locations are printed out when cmake is run, and should look
   something like this:

     -- Found hypertable install path: /usr/local/hypertable/0.9.2.4
     -- Found hypertable config file: /usr/local/hypertable/0.9.2.4/conf/hypertable.cfg
     -- Hypertable was found.

C. Verify that SIGAR was found by CMake. Its needed for linking.

TODO
----
-- search for TODO's in the code and deal witth them.
-- Fix the getIncomingSet() function, its not implemented correctly.
