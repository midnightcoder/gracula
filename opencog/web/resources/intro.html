<p>The OpenCog Framework, which is part of the OpenCog Project (a platform to build and share artificial intelligence programs), includes components for procedural and declarative knowledge representation (AtomTable), task scheduling (CogServer), AI algorithm containers (MindAgents), XML data import and export, connectors to instant messaging and virtual world systems, and other facilities. MindAgents and other add-ons under active development explore a wide variety of AI techniques including evolutionary program learning, probabilistic inference and reasoning, natural language processing, and others.
