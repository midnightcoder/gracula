Opencog Embodiment README
=========================

This readme just describes how to distribute (or deploy) the needed files
(binaries, scripts and config files) for running Embodiment servers.  For more
general information about Embodiment please see
http://www.opencog.org/wiki/Embodiment. Later, other useful Embodiment-related
information should be added here too.

How to distribute, configure and run Embodiment servers
=======================================================

For distributing the files of Embodiment system, just go to:

 <opencog's root dir>/scripts/embodiment

and run the ./makeDistribution script, as follows:

 ./makeDistribution <compile_dir> <dist_subdirectory>

where <compile_dir> is the folder where the opencog was built on
and <dist_subdirectory> is any arbitrary name you want to give for the
distribution directory For example, the following command: 

 ./makeDistribution compile test

will create the directory "<opencog's root dir>/dist/test" and put there all
files needed to configure and run the Embodiment servers. Then:

* For configuring Embodiment, edit the "embodiment.conf" file in the created
distribution folder.
* For running Embodiment servers, run the "pb.csh" script file.
* For killing Embodiment servers, run the "kill.csh" script file.
