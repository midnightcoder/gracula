This document describes the existing golden standards for automated tests. They do not explore all system functionalities, but at least they can be used to check basic parts of them, as follows:

1) gsfile_0.txt(Duration ~4min) - Test the execution of the physiological needs actions: eat, drink, pee and poo. For executing this test, the parameter MILLISECONDS_PER_TICK was setted to 5000 at PetaverseProxy.properties (mv-pvp proxy). The original milliseconds per tick is 500. That configuration put the system to run 10 times faster than usual.

2) gsfile_1.txt(Duration ~4min) - The owner goes near an accessory and waits the pet plays with it. Then goes to another accessory and repeats that behavior. Eventually the onwer grabs an accessory that the pet played with and throws or dropps it in another place and waits the pet plays with it again. Pet recognize the new positions of the accessories and go to play with them.

3) gsfile_2.txt(Duration ~3min) - Test a simple learning process (grab stick), asking the pet to execute it in the playing mode after that.

After each release, it will necessary to create a 'bigger golden' standard that covers as many as possible funcionalities of the pet brain.
