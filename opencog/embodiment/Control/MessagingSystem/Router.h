/**
 * Router is not supposed to be used directly by PB entities. All communication with it is
 * supposed to be performed by NetworkElement's internals. NE encapsulates the protocol
 * used to communicate with Router but in the case you want/need to simulate a NE communicating
 * directly with the router, you may find useful the protocol description provided below.
 *
 * There are five relevant use cases for the protocol:
 *
 * (1) YourEntity starts a handshake with router to enter PB network (no autentication
 * is required at this point. it is just to allow ohet entities to know about YourEntity)
 * (2) YourEntity wants to send a Message to some other entity (it will always contact
 * the router to do so, regardless who is the actual target for that message)
 * (3) YourEntity is asynchronously notified by router that there are unread messages to
 * it waiting in router's queue. YourEntity will need to be listening to a given port
 * to receive such a message.
 * (4) YourEntity decides it wants to retrieve unread messages from router so it sends
 * a proper request (this request will be answered assynchronously by router)
 * (5) YourEntity is assynchronously contaced by router to receive requested unread messages.
 * YourEntity will need to be listening to a given port to receive the messages.
 *
 * (1)
 *
 * Router listens to the port 5005.
 * Open a connection to this port and send the following command:
 *
 * LOGIN <YOUR_ENTITY> <ip> <port>
 *
 * All communication is performed in line-based protocol. So everything
 * should go with an explicit '\n'. (this is true from every command or
 * data line). YOUR_ENTITY is a literal string used to identify YourEntity in
 * PB network. <ip> and <port> will be used to connect to your entity.
 * Please use ports > 5100 (obviously 5005 is already taken).
 *
 * router will answer in the same connection with
 *
 * OK
 *
 * or an error message. Then you can just close the connection.
 *
 * (2)
 *
 * Open a connection to router
 * send the command:
 *
 * NEW_MESSAGE <from> <to> <type> <no. lines>
 *
 * <from> and <to> are the string id of source/target. <from> will be YOUR_ENTITY
 * <to> may be either SPAWNER or any othe PB element you want to contact
 * <type> is message type, e.g. type = 1 is tringMessage.
 * <no. lines> is the number of lines in your message. All messages are broken into
 * lines and sent line by line (lines should not be larger than 1024 chars).
 *
 * So send each line of message.
 *
 * So router will answer with
 *
 * OK
 *
 * or an error message. The message is sent. You can close connection.
 *
 * (3)
 *
 * YourEntity is supposed to be listening to the port passed in handshake. Router will
 * connect to this port and send:
 *
 * cNOTIFY_NEW_MESSAGE
 *
 * the prefix 'c' is not a typo :-)
 * routers closes the connection
 *
 * (4) YourEntity decides it want to retrieve unread messages. It will connect to router's port and send:
 *
 * REQUEST_UNREAD_MESSAGES YOUR_ENTITY <limit>
 *
 * <limit> is the maximum number of messages you expect to be retrieved. -1
 * makes it to retrieve all unread messages. So router may answer
 *
 * OK
 *
 * or an error message. YourEntity closes the connection.
 *
 * (5) router connects to YourEntity's port and send:
 *
 * cSTART_MESSAGE <from> <to> <type>
 *
 * than routers sends one or more lines of data (the message itself). note
 * that each data line is prefixed with 'd'.
 * Than router send either:
 *
 * cSTART_MESSAGE <from> <to> <type>
 *
 * To start sending another message. Or:
 *
 * cNO_MORE_MESSAGES
 *
 * to denote that all messages have been sent already.
 *
 * An important warning is that YourEntity shaw not request message retrieving if it
 * was not notified first about new messages to it in router. The C++ interface provide
 * this automatically but you must take care of it as you are bypassing
 * the interface.
 *
 * (6) Router connects to YourEntity's port and send:
 *
 * cAVAILABLE_ELEMENT <elementId>
 * or
 * cUNAVAILABLE_ELEMENT <elementId>
 *
 * to indicate a specific Network Element became available or unavailable
