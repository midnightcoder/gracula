/**
BITNode class implements a compact inference tree representation, where each BITNode encapsulates
a Rule and
a vector of sets of other BITNode, where each set contains all the possible ways to get a result
for the argument slot in question.
Furthermore, BITNodes are parametrized, so that a single BITNode may stand for various inference
targets which differ only in the naming of the variables contained in them.

RuleApp class implements a comprehensive inference tree
representation, where you can know exactly which sequence of Rules and
intermediate results did produce a certain final result. (This is not
completely trivial, since it is not possible to store the explicit Rule
application trees for all the possible combinations of Rule applications
to tree depth N.)

In going backwards, then, we use BITNode to minimize the space
requirements for storing the trees.
In going forward, ie. applying some inference pathways present in
BITNode, we pass the results upward as RuleApp objects (whose
arguments lists are bound), rather than as direct Handles as before.

The RuleApp objects have 3 uses:

- Record the exact Rule application sequence. (previously this was done
using a cumbersome map structure)

- In a repository of (RuleApp, Resulting Handle, Resulting Handle's
fitness) tuples, one can easily mine for various statistically
interesting patterns of the form:
"what kinds of RuleApps are useful for producing what kinds of atoms?"

- A RuleApp can be used as a "macro Rule" which composes multiple
Rules into a single one. You can bind part of its arguments beforehand
with either vtrees (Handles) or with other RuleApps (some of which may
have complete and some incomplete argument lists). The RuleApp then
behaves like a Rule whose arity is the number of NULL arguments in all
the Rules it incorporates, and the ordering of the arguments starts from
the left-bottom-most Rule.

Eg. Dedu(Inv(A), Dedu($1, B)) takes one argument (bound to $1), whereas
Dedu(Inv($2), Dedu($1, B)) takes 2 args (1st one binds to $2, the 2nd
one to $1). Etc.
