/***

StrictCrispUnificationRule has essentially been obsoleted by CustomCrispUnificationRule,
but we keep it here because its fundamentally different approach.
StrictCrispUnificationRule is a single stand-alone Rule, whereas Custom versions work so that
for each quantified atom struct, there'll be a new associated Custom Rule.

For StrictCrispUnificationRule:

Problem: StrictCrispUnificationRule has to bind FW_VARs, but it uses a design hack
which gathers hints from Atom Table instead of being pure o2i. Hence, it will
have to make var bindings, but it cannot return the information about them in
any way!

Solutions:
a) Do not bind FW_VARs. o2i returns the ForAllLink and the internals as-is,
containing the FW_VARs as they were passed to o2i from above.
BUT: FW_VARs were bound in a specific way in order to make StrictCrispUnificationRule
work. If they are left unbound, then they may be bound elsewhere in a way
which prevents StrictCrispUnificationRule from working, without our being able
to know this.

b) DO bind FW_VARs. 
BUT: Since we use direct production, bindings cannot be returned.
We can apply the bindings immediately to the ForAllLink's internals,
but then we have made local bindings without being able to pass knowledge of
that to other processes. Hence, if $1 (FW_VAR) was bound here in a certain way,
it can be bound on another branch different way, and if these branches are
combined, no conflict will be found!
