/**
 * This class implements a base server class that provides basic functionality
 * for third parties who might wish to use their custom server.
 * There are only two primitives provided by this class: an atomspace instance
 * and a factory method.
 *
 * Applications extending the BaseServer must ensure that:
 *      1. the derived server overrides the factory method 'createInstance'
 *      2. the first call to the 'opencog::server()' global function explicitly
 *         passes the derived server's factory method as parameter.
 *
 * See the files CogServerMain.cc, CogServerh and CogServercc for examples.
