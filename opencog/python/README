This directory holds the Python language bindings for the OpenCog framework, 
written using Boost.Python .

The "hello" directory contains good example code for wrapping various C++ 
constructs.  All other directories contain wrapping code for their respective 
directories.

Todos:
    - Look into opencog/dynamics/attention for examples.
    - When done with bindings, remove PyOSG from references.
    - No need for Atom class, Node and Link are fine.
    - TruthValue not so much, SimpleTV, CompositeTV, IndefiniteTV, CountTV
    - AttentionValue, Handle, Link, and Node
