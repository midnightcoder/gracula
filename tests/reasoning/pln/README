=== Various files ===

indented2xml.pl: an obsolete script to convert the Indented format (used in the PLN book) to an obsolete XML format.
ocxml2scm.sh   : hacky, but working script to convert files from OpenCog's XML format to Scheme.
trail* or Trail*: Descriptions of the inferences used to achieve various things in 2006. Should still be correct.
unused/        : files that were previously used in PLN but are now obsolete.
rules/         : new C++ tests for Rules should be put here.
formulas/      : new C++ tests for Formulas should be put here.

=== Test data files ===

The *.xml files are PLN test data from when Ari was working on it in 2006. Most or all of them are still used in PLNUTest. There are Scheme versions in the scm/ subdirectory, which are much easier to read. Currently PLNUTest only uses the Scheme version.
scm/README provides a description of the files.

=== The new PLN test system ===

PLNUTest can now use files in the tests/reasoning/pln/targets directory.
Each file specifies one target for backward chaining inference, and some other
related information. PLNUTest will load each file and run the inference specified in it. The files are in the OpenCog configuration file format, and the targets are specified in Scheme (see http://www.opencog.org/wiki/Scheme).

Here is an example file (tests/reasoning/pln/targets/InheritanceOsamaAbu_test.conf), with comments.:

    # Gets printed at the start of the test
    COMMENT = Test inheritance Osama/Abu.

    # Filename extension is added automatically; could support a list of files
    # easily
    LOAD = smalldemo

    # The target (in Scheme). Must all be one line.
    TARGET =  (InheritanceLink (ConceptNode "Osama") (ConceptNode "Abu"))

    # The minimum and maximum TV required to pass
    MIN_TV = [0.0001,0.90]
    MAX_TV = [0.999,1.01]

    # The maximum number of steps allowed for exploring/expanding the BIT.
    # The corresponding parameter in the PLNUTest internals is actually
    # the number of expansion phases * 10. There are 1000 expansions in each phase.
    # So this is always 100 times the number in PLNUTest.cxxtest
    MAX_STEPS = 4000

The targets_disabled/ directory contains target files that have been temporarily disabled. The subdirectories within targets/ and targets_disabled/ are the same. Currently, files directly contained in the directory are ported from Ari's work in PLNUTest. The new/ directory contains recent ones. This structure may change at any time.
