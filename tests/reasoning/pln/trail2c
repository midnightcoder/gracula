Then, if H has not been done yet, we may proceed to expand the action sequence with the following paradigm:

Unification: 
ForAll
Implies
   AND
	PredImp
		SequentialAND
			$h
			$g
		$r
	PredImp
		$z
		$h
   PredImp
	SequentialAND

		$g
	$r
PredImp
	SimAND
		can H
		try H
	done H
PredImp
	SequentialAND
		done H
		try G
	Reward
|-
PredImp
	SequentialAND
		SimAND
			can H
			try H
		try G
	Reward

etc.
