********
Overview
********

Meta-optimizing semantic evolutionary search (MOSES) is a new approach to
program evolution, based on representation-building and probabilistic
modeling. MOSES has been successfully applied to solve hard problems in domains
such as computational biology, sentiment evaluation, and agent control. Results
tend to be more accurate, and require less objective function evaluations, in
comparison to other program evolution systems. Best of all, the result of
running MOSES is not a large nested structure or numerical vector, but a
compact and comprehensible program written in a simple Lisp-like
mini-language. For more information see http://metacog.org/doc.html .

********
The Code
********

The code for reproducing all of the published experiments on MOSES (see below)
may be found in the src/ subdirectory. 


************
Installation
************

You need to have a recent gcc (4.x or late 3.x), the boost libraries 
(http://www.boost.org) and the CMake package (http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Index.html).
Go to the directory bin (from the root folder of the MOSES distribution)
and run "cmake ..". This will create the needed build files. Then, make 
the project using "make" (again from the directory bin).

Generated executables will be in the folder bin/src/main.
